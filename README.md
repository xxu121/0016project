## TESTING EVERY SINGLE SENSOR IS USEABLE

To ensure that each sensor is operational and free from any functional defects, it's advisable to run a diagnostic test using specific testing code. This process will also verify that all sensors are properly connected to the Arduino board, with no issues related to connectivity. Code for testing each sensor from [Sensors Test Folder](sensors%20test/)

PIR sensor --> pin 10


Buzzer --> pin11


Using a breadboard for connecting sensors is a simple and effective way to prototype electronics projects. When connecting sensors: Attach the sensor's power (VCC) and ground (GND) pins to the breadboard's power rails. Then connect the sensor's data pin(s) to the Arduino Uno (in this project) using jumper wires.
